# Outlier-Flow matrix-Estimation
Pleae use file "RPCA_PK". RPCA is performed using Accelerated Proximal Gradient method. The function "rpca" requires a flow matrix M for evaluating low rank matrix L and sparse matrix S. You may be required to do some tuning of parameter lambda. Please refer to the original paper for some recommendations. Feel free to contact kumar372@umn.edu if you have questions
