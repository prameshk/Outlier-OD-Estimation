# Outlier-Flow matrix-Estimation
Pleae use file "RPCA_PK". RPCA is performed using Accelerated Proximal Gradient Method. Use function "rpca" which requires a flow matrix M for evaluating low rank matrix L and sparse matrix S. You can do tuning of parameter $\lambda$ using the procedure explained in the figure
