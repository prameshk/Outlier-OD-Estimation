# Outlier-Flow matrix-Estimation
Pleae use file "RPCA_PK". RPCA is performed using Accelerated Proximal Gradient method. Use the function "rpca" which requires a flow matrix M for evaluating low rank matrix L and sparse matrix S. You may be required to do the tuning of parameter lambda. Please refer to the original paper for some recommendations.
